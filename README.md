Predicting The Energy Output Of The Wind Turbine Based On Weather Condition

Project Description:
	Wind energy is one of the most developed renewable energy.A wind turbine can produce more than 6 million kwh in a year.The energy production in a wind farm depends on attributes like wind speed,climate change,turbine size,wind flow in a particular site and height of the site from sea level etc.70% of the wind energy produced during the five month duration from may to september coinciding with southwest monsoon duration.There is no that much amount of storage place to store the energy.Due to this problem the wind turbine should be stopped for some time.Because there is no demand.This will cause the energy over production.By contrast in the another season due to less wind flow and climate changes the amount of energy production was minimum.To avoid these problem energy production should be predicted.If the output energy predicted,then we can collaborate energy suppliers to produce the constant amount of energy in all duration.The output energy can be predicted by using the time series models.
